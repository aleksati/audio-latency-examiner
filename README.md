Audio Latency Examiner (ALEX) is an easy-to-use standalone app for batch collecting audio latency data from any external or internal musical device. You can use it to collect data from devices such as analog hardware, networked systems, virtual audio drivers, VSTs, and more. The app collects latency data by evaluating the arrival time differences between audio impulses (click~) that the software itself administers and passes through a given audio device.

ALEX builds on the code examples from Graham Wakefield on batch-collecting audio latency data in MaxMSP (Read more about this on the [Cycling '74 forum](https://cycling74.com/forums/long-term-changes-in-audio-roundtrip-latency/replies/1#reply-58ed21b3c2991221d9ccaba6)) and is inspired by my time as a teacher for several networked music courses at UiO.
